Follow topic:\\n\\nAI/artificial intelligence\\n\\nPublished May 05, 2025, 05:00 AM\\n\\nUpdated May 05, 2025, 09:22 AM\\n\\nSINGAPORE – Singapore’s home-grown large language model (LLM), Sea-Lion, is steadily gaining traction, with some 235,000 downloads so far, bolstered by adoption by large companies such as GoTo Group in Indonesia.\\n\\nAfter releasing the latest model with “reasoning” capabilities on April 15, its researchers at AI Singapore told The Straits Times that they plan to add voice recognition later in 2025, followed by other modalities such as visual recognition.\\n\\nThe new features are expected to enhance the model’s usability in a region rich in spoken and unwritten languages. The model currently recognises 13 languages, including Javanese, Sudanese, Malay, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese, as well as English and Chinese.\\n\\nSea-Lion is already tapped by some businesses for its language features, with GoTo among the first enterprises to adopt Sea-Lion in February 2024 as a base to build its own artificial intelligence (AI) system.\\n\\nIts chief data officer, Mr Ofir Shalev, noted: “Training a model from scratch is often prohibitively expensive. So like many in the industry, we adopted a continuous pre-training approach – building on an existing model as the starting point.”\\n\\nGoTo’s Sahabat-AI model is now benchmarked as more accurate in reading and interpreting Bahasa Indonesia, Javanese and Sundanese than other models of similar size, according to Mr Shalev.\\n\\nThe $70 million Sea-Lion init\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/783dda83b56fab7796305b184daca1556df56abd72a1d2310af38202565a5fed\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.straitstimes.com/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914\",\n      \"title\": \"Mitigating Bias, Ensuring Fairness: SEA-LION's Strategies for Inclusive LLM in a Diverse Region\",\n      \"url\": \"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-02-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"See all articles by Lionel Koh\",\n      \"text\": \"[Skip to main content](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914#maincontent)\\n\\n[![PDF icon](https://static.ssrn.com/cfincludes/img/icons/icon-adobe-pdf.svg)Download This Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5128914.pdf?abstractid=5128914&mirid=1)\\n\\n[Open PDF in Browser](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5128914.pdf?abstractid=5128914&mirid=1&type=2)\\n\\n[Add Paper to My Library](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914)\\n\\nShare:\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nUsing these links will ensure access to this page indefinitely\\n\\n[Copy URL](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914)\\n\\n[Copy DOI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914)\\n\\n# Mitigating Bias, Ensuring Fairness: SEA-LION's Strategies for Inclusive LLM in a Diverse Region\\n\\n21 PagesPosted: 7 Apr 2025\\n\\n[See all articles by Lionel Koh](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7394897)\\n\\n## [Lionel Koh](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7394897)\\n\\nGolden Gate University - Ageno School of Business\\n\\n## [Jirat Boomuang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7293717)\\n\\nGolden Gate University - Ageno School of Business\\n\\n## [Pyn Lim](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7394898)\\n\\nGolden Gate University - Ageno School of Business\\n\\n## [Francis Wang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7375355)\\n\\nFW.VISION Futures Thinking Inc.; Golden Gate University - Ageno School of Business; University of Calgary; Quantic School of Business & Technology; Conrad School of Entrepreneurship and Business Faculty of Engineering, University of Waterloo\\n\\nDate Written: February 07, 2025\\n\\n### Abstract\\n\\nThis paper examines the SEA-LION suite of open-source large language models developed by AI Singapore, exploring its strategies for mitigating bias and promoting fairness within the diverse linguistic and cultural context of Southeast Asia.

Update\\n\\n**Rockhopper Exploration plc**\\n\\n(“Rockhopper” or the “Company”)\\n\\n**Sea Lion Operator’s Update**\\n\\nRockhopper Exploration plc (AIM: RKH), the oil and gas company with key interests in the North Falkland Basin (“NFB”), notes the recent publication by Navitas Petroleum LP (“Navitas” or the “Operator”) of and an updated NFB independent resource report conducted by Netherland Sewell & Associates (“NSAI”) (the “March 2025 NSAI Independent Report”) on behalf of Navitas.  The report reflects work carried out to mature the resource base and accelerates later phases of the development programme in the build up to FID.  Overall resources at Sea Lion remain unchanged.  As a result of the work carried out, a significant number of barrels have been moved from ‘Development On Hold’ to ‘Development Pending’ classification.\\n\\n**March 2025 NSAI Independent Report**\\n\\nThe new March 2025 NSAI report, which Rockhopper has not reviewed, categorises the Sea Lion resources into the following developments:\\n\\n·   Northern area, 3 phases\\n\\n·   Central area, 2 phases\\n\\n·   Northern Area Phases 1 and 2 will be developed using a redeployed and upgraded FPSO that is expected to be secured upon FID.\\n\\n·   Northern Area phase 3 and the Central Area Phases 1 and 2 will require a substantially larger replacement FPSO to be identified and secured.\\n\\nThe Development on Hold category of 178 MMbbls 2C includes gross resources within Sea Lion and Isobel/Elaine, that could be developed under future phases but for which there is currently no published development plan.\\n\\n**Key Information**\\n\\n2C Contingent Resources (Development Pending) phased development concept for the Sea Lion field:\\n\\n·   64 wells\\n\\n·   Phased

steadily gaining traction, with some 235,000 downloads so far, bolstered by adoption by large companies such as GoTo Group in Indonesia.\\n\\nAfter releasing the latest model with “reasoning” capabilities on April 15, its researchers at AI Singapore told The Straits Times that they plan to add voice recognition later in 2025, followed by other modalities such as visual recognition.\\n\\nThe new features are expected to enhance the model’s usability in a region rich in spoken and unwritten languages. The model currently recognises 13 languages, including Javanese, Sudanese, Malay, Tamil, Thai and Vietnamese, as well as English and Chinese.\\n\\nSea-Lion is already tapped by some businesses for its language features, with GoTo among the first enterprises to adopt Sea-Lion in February 2024 as a base to build its own artificial intelligence (AI) system.\\n\\nIts chief data officer, Mr Ofir Shalev, noted: “Training a model from scratch is often prohibitively expensive. So like many in the industry, we adopted a continuous pre-training approach – building on an existing model as the starting point.”\\n\\nGoTo’s Sahabat-AI model is now benchmarked as more accurate in reading and interpreting Bahasa Indonesia, Javanese and Sundanese than other models of similar size, according to Mr Shalev.\\n\\nThe $70 million Sea-Lion init\",\n      \"image\": \"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/783dda83b56fab7796305b184daca1556df56abd72a1d2310af38202565a5fed\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.straitstimes.com/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914\",\n      \"title\": \"Mitigating Bias, Ensuring Fairness: SEA-LION's Strategies for Inclusive LLM in a Diverse Region\",\n      \"url\": \"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-02-07T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"See all articles by Lionel Koh\",\n      \"text\": \"[Skip to main content](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914#maincontent)\\n\\n[![PDF icon](https://static.ssrn.com/cfincludes/img/icons/icon-adobe-pdf.svg)Download This Paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5128914.pdf?abstractid=5128914&mirid=1)\\n\\n[Open PDF in Browser](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/5128914.pdf?abstractid=5128914&mirid=1&type=2)\\n\\n[Add Paper to My Library](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914)\\n\\nShare:\\n\\nPermalink\\n\\nUsing these links will ensure access to this page indefinitely\\n\\n[Copy URL](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914)\\n\\n[Copy DOI](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5128914)\\n\\n# Mitigating Bias, Ensuring Fairness: SEA-LION's Strategies for Inclusive LLM in a Diverse Region\\n\\n21 PagesPosted: 7 Apr 2025\\n\\n[See all articles by Lionel Koh](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7394897)\\n\\n## [Lionel Koh](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7394897)\\n\\nGolden Gate University - Ageno School of Business\\n\\n## [Jirat Boomuang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7293717)\\n\\nGolden Gate University - Ageno School of Business\\n\\n## [Pyn Lim](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7394898)\\n\\nGolden Gate University - Ageno School of Business\\n\\n## [Francis Wang](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=7375355)\\n\\nFW.VISION Futures Thinking Inc.; Golden Gate University - Ageno School of Business; University of Calgary; Quantic School of Business & Technology; Conrad School of Entrepreneurship and Business Faculty of Engineering, University of Waterloo\\n\\nDate Written: February 07, 2025\\n\\n### Abstract\\n\\nThis paper examines the SEA-LION suite of open-source large language models developed by AI Singapore, exploring its strategies for mitigating bias and promoting fairness within the diverse linguistic and cultural context of Southeast Asia.

The first LLM focused on Southeast Asia, SEA-LION enables developers to build applications in Southeast Asian languages, optimizing them for on-device deployment on Snapdragon platforms.\\n\\n### **SEA-LION –built for Southeast Asia, by Southeast Asia**\\n\\nWith a diverse population of more than 675 million people and a growing significance on the global stage, ASEAN countries need LLMs that are custom built for the region. SEA-LION is a family of open-source LLMs that better understands Southeast Asia’s diverse contexts, languages, and cultures.\\n\\nSEA-LION is an open-source project anchored by the Products Pillar of AI Singapore. AI Singapore’s work on SEA-LION aims to create LLMs that cater to under-represented population groups and low resource languages in the SEA region. AI Singapore does this by training SEA-LION on native content in Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesia, Thai, and other Southeast Asian languages.\\n\\nAvailable on Qualcomm AI Hub, the SEA-LION v3.5 is based on Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B.

added a new Large Language Model (LLM) to Qualcomm AI Hub: SEA-LION (Southeast Asian Languages in One Network), developed by AI Singapore. The first LLM focused on Southeast Asia, SEA-LION enables developers to build applications in Southeast Asian languages, optimizing them for on-device deployment on Snapdragon platforms.\\n\\n### **SEA-LION –built for Southeast Asia, by Southeast Asia**\\n\\nWith a diverse population of more than 675 million people and a growing significance on the global stage, ASEAN countries need LLMs that are custom built for the region. SEA-LION is a family of open-source LLMs that better understands Southeast Asia’s diverse contexts, languages, and cultures.\\n\\nSEA-LION is an open-source project anchored by the Products Pillar of AI Singapore. AI Singapore’s work on SEA-LION aims to create LLMs that cater to under-represented population groups and low resource languages in the SEA region. AI Singapore does this by training SEA-LION on native content in Vietnamese, Bahasa Indonesia, Thai, and other Southeast Asian languages.\\n\\nAvailable on Qualcomm AI Hub, the SEA-LION v3.5 is based on Meta’s Llama 3.1 8B. This version has been quantized and pre-optimized for deployment on devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite and Snapdragon X Elite, enabling responsive performance without relying on the cloud.\\n\\n### **Unlocking intelligent applications for Southeast Asia with Qualcomm AI Hub**\\n\\nQualcomm AI Hub simplifies the process of deploying AI models on edge devices. By leveraging SEA-LION via the Qualcomm AI Hub, developers get:\\n\\n- A regionally relevant LLM tuned for Southeast Asian languages and cultural context\\n- Pre-optimized deployment packages ready to run on Snapdragon hardware\\n- Documentation and tools that streamline testing and integration\\n\\nThis enables faster and easier prototyping and development for applications such as chatbots\",\n      \"image\": \"https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/dmqualcommprod/SEA-LION-HERO\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.qualcomm.com/etc.clientlibs/qcomm-martech/clientlibs/clientlib-react/resources/favicon/qualcomm/favicon.ico\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/25/sea-lion-v4-multimodal-language-modeling-for-southeast-asia/\",\n      \"title\": \"SEA-LION v4: Multimodal Language Modeling for Southeast Asia\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/25/sea-lion-v4-multimodal-language-modeling-for-southeast-asia/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-08-25T00:00:00.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"Asif Razzaq\",\n      \"text\": \"[Discord](https://pxl.to/ivxz41s)[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marktechpost/?viewAsMember=true)[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearningnews/)[Twitter](https://twitter.com/Marktechpost)\\n\\n- [Home](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Open Source/Weights](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/open-source/)\\n- [Enterprise AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/enterprise-ai/)\\n- [Robotics](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/robotics/)\\n- [AI Agents](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/ai-agents/)\\n- [MCP](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/model-context-protocol-mcp/)\\n- [Tutorials](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/tutorials/)\\n- [Voice AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/artificial-intelligence/voice-ai/)\\n- [Sponsorship](https://calendly.com/marktechpost/marktechpost-promotion-call)\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n[NewsHub](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\n[NewsHub](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n\\n[Premium Content](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Read our exclusive articles](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Facebook](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Instagram](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n[Twitter](https://www.marktechpost.com/www.marktechpost.com)\\n\\n- [Home](https://www.marktechpost.com/)\\n- [Open Source/Weights](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/open-source/)\\n- [Enterprise AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/enterprise-ai/)\\n- [Robotics](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/robotics/)\\n- [AI Agents](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/ai-agents/)\\n- [MCP](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/editors-pick/model-context-protocol-mcp/)\\n- [Tutorials](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/tutorials/)\\n- [Voice AI](https://www.marktechpost.com/category/technology/artificial-intelligence/voice-ai/)\\n- [Sponsorship](https://calendly.com/marktechpost/marktechpost-promotion-call)\",\n      \"image\": \"http://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/blog-banner-1-2.png\",\n      \"favicon\": \"https://www.marktechpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cropped-Favicon-512-x-512-1-1-32x32.png\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"id\": \"https://www.aiforumcambodia.org/%F0%9F%93%A2-announcing-sea-lion-v4-advancing-open-multimodal-ai-for-southeast-asia/\",\n      \"title\": \"Announcing SEA-LION v4 – Advancing Open, Multimodal AI for ...\",\n      \"url\": \"https://www.aiforumcambodia.org/%F0%9F%93%A2-announcing-sea-lion-v4-advancing-open-multimodal-ai-for-southeast-asia/\",\n      \"publishedDate\": \"2025-09-03T01:16:56.000Z\",\n      \"author\": \"chabsombol\",\n      \"text\": \"- [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/people/AI-Forum/61559084635541/)\\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/AIForumchannel)\\n- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ai_forum_kh/)\\n- [X](https://x.com/AIForumKH)\\n- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aiforumkh/)\\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AIForum_KH)\\n\\n# 📢 Announcing SEA-LION v4 – Advancing Open, Multimodal AI for Southeast Asia\\n\\n3 September, 2025\\n\\nAI Forum is pleased to announce that AI Singapore has released SEA-LION v4, a major advancement in open, multimodal artificial intelligence designed for Southeast Asia (including Khmer language for Cambodia) and beyond.

You can ask me to:\n- Add more information (like model name, time, etc.)\n- Change colors\n- Modify the format\n- Add custom elements from the JSON input"}],"totalDurationMs":94587,"totalTokens":10907,"totalToolUseCount":7,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":926,"cache_read_input_tokens":8561,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":926,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1415,"service_tier":"standard"}}}
