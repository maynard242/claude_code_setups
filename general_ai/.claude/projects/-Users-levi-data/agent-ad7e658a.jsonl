The launch of SEA-LION v4 at Google Cloud AI Asia is a milestone for the collaboration between AI Singapore and Google Cloud.\\nThis state-of-the-art, multimodal model for Southeast Asia was developed by leveraging our deep partnership. The AISG team utilized Google Cloud's Vertex AI to accelerate the complex training and tuning process on the world-class Gemma 3 architecture. Our managed infrastructure and MLOps tooling simplified workflows, enabling the creation of a high-performing model built on SEA data.\\nThe result is a resource-efficient, multilingual model that truly understands local context. This project showcases how our partnership provides the essential infrastructure to train and build cutting-edge AI in and for Singapore.\\nReady to use it?

Currently, he serves in multiple prominent capacities, including as a Smart Nation Fellow at GovTech, a Senior Director at AI Singapore, and a Board Member at IPOS, Sofina, and Coinbase.\\n\\nReflecting on Dr. Teo’s remarkable career, it is evident that his journey has been shaped by strategic decisions made at pivotal moments. His ability to navigate complex and uncertain environments with agility and foresight is something we can all learn from—especially here at SMC (Singapore Mentorship Committee) .\\n\\nWe were privileged to have Dr. Teo share his insights and advice on the topic, “Navigating Change and Seizing Opportunities.\\\"\\n\\nA Passion for Technology and AI\\n\\nDr. Teo opened his talk by sharing his personal journey, emphasizing that his current passion lies in technology and artificial intelligence. Over the last five years, he has been deeply involved in AI, particularly in the development of large language models for Southeast Asia. One such initiative, SeaLion, is a Singapore-based project aimed at establishing the nation as a leader in AI innovation.\\n\\nDr. Teo recalled the skepticisms.

The launch of SEA-LION v4 at Google Cloud AI Asia is a milestone for the collaboration between AI Singapore and Google Cloud.\\nThis state-of-the-art, multimodal model for Southeast Asia was developed by leveraging our deep partnership. The AISG team utilized Google Cloud's Vertex AI to accelerate the complex training and tuning process on the world-class Gemma 3 architecture. Our managed infrastructure and MLOps tooling simplified workflows, enabling the creation of a high-performing model built on SEA data.\\nThe result is a resource-efficient, multilingual model that truly understands local context.
