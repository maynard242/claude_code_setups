5. **Synthesis**
   - Organize findings by theme
   - Highlight key insights and implications
   - Note gaps in available information
   - Provide actionable conclusions

## Deliverable Format

Provide a structured report:
- **Executive Summary**: Key findings in 3-5 bullet points
- **Detailed Findings**: Organized by theme with evidence
- **Analysis**: Patterns, trends, implications
- **Conclusion**: Actionable recommendations
- **Sources**: Complete citations with URLs and access dates
- **Confidence Assessment**: High/Medium/Low for major claims
